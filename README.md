# Puppet
Puppet is a software configuration management tool developed by Puppet Inc.[3] Puppet is used to manage stages of the IT infrastructure lifecycle.[4]

Puppet uses an open-core model; its free-software version was released under version 2 of the GNU General Public License (GPL) until version 2.7.0,[5] and later releases use the Apache License, while Puppet Enterprise uses a proprietary license.

Puppet and Puppet Enterprise operate on multiple Unix-like systems (including Linux, Solaris, BSD, Mac OS X, AIX, HP-UX) and has Microsoft Windows support.[6][7] Puppet itself is written in Ruby. Facter, Puppetâ€™s cross-platform system profiling library, is written in C++. Puppet Server and Puppet DB are written in Clojure.[8]
